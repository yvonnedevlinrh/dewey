# Dewey

Knowledge graph MCP server that gives AI full access to your knowledge graph. Supports **Logseq** and **Obsidian** — both with full read-write support. Navigate pages, search blocks, analyze link structure, track decisions, manage flashcards, compile knowledge, curate knowledge stores, and write content — all through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

Hard fork of [graphthulhu](https://github.com/skridlevsky/graphthulhu) by Max Skridlevsky, extended with persistent SQLite storage, vector-based semantic search via Ollama, pluggable LLM providers (Ollama, Vertex AI), pluggable content sources (disk, GitHub, web crawl, code), knowledge compilation with temporal intelligence, curated knowledge stores, and trust tiers for the [Unbound Force](https://github.com/unbound-force) AI agent swarm ecosystem.

Built in Go with the [official MCP Go SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk).

## Why

Your knowledge graph stores interconnected pages, blocks, and links. But AI assistants can't see any of it — they're blind to your second brain.

Dewey fixes that. It exposes your entire knowledge graph through MCP, so any MCP client can:

- Read any page with its full block tree, parsed links, tags, and properties
- Search across all blocks with contextual results (parent chain + siblings)
- Traverse the link graph to discover how concepts connect
- Find knowledge gaps — orphan pages, dead ends, weakly-linked areas
- Discover topic clusters through connected component analysis
- Create pages, write blocks, build hierarchies, link pages bidirectionally
- Query with raw DataScript/Datalog for anything the built-in tools don't cover (Logseq)
- Review flashcards with spaced repetition statistics (Logseq)
- Explore whiteboards and their spatial connections (Logseq)

It turns "tell me about X" into an AI that actually understands your knowledge graph's structure.

## Tools

50 tools across 15 categories. Most work with both backends; some are Logseq-only (DataScript queries, flashcards, whiteboards).

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install --cask unbound-force/tap/dewey
```

The cask includes a signed and notarized binary. Ollama is installed automatically as a dependency.

### go install (all platforms)

```bash
go install github.com/unbound-force/dewey/v3@latest
```

Requires Go 1.25+. Works on macOS, Linux, and any platform with a Go toolchain.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unbound-force/dewey.git
cd dewey
go build -o dewey .
```

### Setup: Logseq

1. In Logseq, go to **Settings → Features** and enable **HTTP APIs server**
2. Click the **API** icon that appears in the top toolbar
3. Click **Start Server**
4. Click **Create Token** and copy the generated token — you'll need it for configuration

The API runs on `http://127.0.0.1:12315` by default.

### Setup: Obsidian

No plugins or server required. Dewey reads your vault's `.md` files directly.

You need to provide the path to your vault:

```bash
dewey serve --backend obsidian --vault /path/to/your/vault
```

Or via environment variables:

```bash
export DEWEY_BACKEND=obsidian
export OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=/path/to/your/vault
dewey
```

The Obsidian backend supports full read-write operations. It parses YAML frontmatter into properties, builds a block tree from headings, and indexes `[[wikilinks]]` for backlink resolution. Writes use atomic temp-file renames, and the in-memory index is rebuilt after every mutation. File watching (fsnotify) keeps the index in sync with external edits. Daily notes are detected from a configurable subfolder (default: `daily notes`).

## Configuration

### Logseq — OpenCode

Add to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "dewey": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["dewey"],
      "env": {
        "LOGSEQ_API_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:12315",
        "LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Obsidian — OpenCode

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "dewey": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["dewey", "--backend", "obsidian", "--vault", "/path/to/your/vault"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Read-only mode

To disable all write operations (Obsidian backend, the default):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "dewey": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["dewey", "--read-only", "--backend", "obsidian", "--vault", "/path/to/your/vault"]
    }
  }
}
```

For the Logseq backend (requires Logseq running with API enabled):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "dewey": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["dewey", "--read-only", "--backend", "logseq"],
      "env": {
        "LOGSEQ_API_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:12315",
        "LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Version control warning

On startup with the Logseq backend, Dewey checks if your graph directory is git-controlled. If not, it prints a warning to stderr suggesting you initialize version control. Write operations cannot be undone without it.

### Persistence

Dewey stores its index in `.uf/dewey/graph.db` (SQLite). The database holds pages, blocks, links, vector embeddings, and source metadata. After the first full index, subsequent sessions load from the persistent index and only reprocess changed files — startup is near-instant.

Run `dewey init` to create the `.uf/dewey/` directory with default configuration:

```bash
dewey init
```

This creates:
- `.uf/dewey/config.yaml` — embedding model and endpoint settings
- `.uf/dewey/sources.yaml` — content source configuration (empty by default)
- `.uf/dewey/graph.db` — created automatically on first `dewey serve` or `dewey index`
- `.uf/dewey/dewey.log` — created automatically by `dewey serve` for MCP server diagnostics (truncated at 10 MB on startup)

Add `.uf/dewey/` to your `.gitignore`. The index is machine-local and rebuilt from source files.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LOGSEQ_API_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:12315` | Logseq HTTP API endpoint |
| `LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN` | (required for Logseq) | Bearer token from Logseq settings |
| `DEWEY_BACKEND` | `obsidian` | Backend type: `obsidian` (default) or `logseq` |
| `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` | — | Path to Obsidian vault root |
| `DEWEY_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `granite-embedding:30m` | Ollama embedding model name |
| `DEWEY_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama API endpoint |
| `DEWEY_AUTHOR` | — | Override author identity for `store_learning` (useful in CI or shared environments) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` | — | GitHub API token for content sources |

### Global flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Enable debug logging (shows UUID seeds, block insertions, lock detection) |
| `--log-file PATH` | | Write logs to file in addition to stderr |
| `--no-embeddings` | | Skip embedding generation (on serve, index, reindex) |
| `--vault PATH` | | Path to vault (on serve, index, reindex, status, search, doctor, manifest) |

When running as an MCP server (`dewey serve`), Dewey automatically logs to `.uf/dewey/dewey.log` for diagnostics. The log file is truncated when it exceeds 10 MB.

## CLI Commands

### dewey init

Initialize a Dewey configuration in the current directory. Creates `.uf/dewey/` with default `config.yaml` and `sources.yaml`.

```bash
dewey init [--vault PATH]
```

### dewey index

Build or update the knowledge graph and embedding indexes from all configured sources. Uses content hashing for incremental updates — only re-indexes changed files.

```bash
dewey index [--vault PATH] [--source NAME] [--force] [--no-embeddings]
```

- `--force` — Re-fetch all sources, even if within their refresh interval
- `--no-embeddings` — Skip embedding generation (keyword search still works)

### dewey reindex

Delete the existing index and rebuild from scratch. Use when upgrading Dewey, recovering from corruption, or after fixing UUID collision issues.

```bash
dewey reindex [--vault PATH] [--no-embeddings]
```

This removes `graph.db`, WAL/SHM files, and the lock file before rebuilding. Requires stopping `dewey serve` first (the lock file prevents concurrent access).

### dewey status

Report index health: page count, block count, embedding coverage, source status.

```bash
dewey status [--vault PATH] [--json]
```

### dewey doctor

Run diagnostic checks for Dewey dependencies and report pass/fail with fix instructions. Checks: workspace initialization, database health (per-source page counts), Ollama availability, embedding model status, MCP server process, and opencode.json configuration.

```bash
dewey doctor [--vault PATH]
```

### dewey search

Full-text search across the knowledge graph (local files and external sources from graph.db).

```bash
dewey search [--vault PATH] [--limit N] QUERY
```

### dewey source add

Add a content source (GitHub or web) to the configuration.

```bash
dewey source add github --org ORG --repos REPO1,REPO2 [--refresh INTERVAL]
dewey source add web --url URL [--name NAME] [--depth N] [--refresh INTERVAL]
```

### dewey manifest

Generate `.uf/dewey/manifest.md` — a structured summary of CLI commands, MCP tools, and exported packages discovered via AST parsing of Go source files.

```bash
dewey manifest [--vault PATH]
```

### dewey journal

Append a block to a Logseq journal page.

```bash
dewey journal [--vault PATH] CONTENT
```

### dewey add

Append a block to a named Logseq page.

```bash
dewey add [--vault PATH] PAGE CONTENT
```

### dewey compile

Synthesize stored learnings into compiled knowledge articles. Reads all learnings, clusters them by topic tag, and produces current-state articles that resolve temporal contradictions — newer facts replace older ones.

```bash
dewey compile [--vault PATH]
```

### dewey lint

Scan the knowledge base for quality issues: stale decisions, embedding gaps, contradictions, and orphaned content.

```bash
dewey lint [--vault PATH] [--fix]
```

### dewey promote

Promote a page from `draft` tier to `validated` after human review. Only draft-tier pages (agent-generated content) can be promoted.

```bash
dewey promote [--vault PATH] PAGE_NAME
```

### dewey curate

Run the curation pipeline to extract structured knowledge from indexed sources into knowledge stores. Uses an LLM (via Ollama) to analyze indexed content and produce curated markdown files with confidence scoring and quality flags.

```bash
dewey curate [--vault PATH] [--store NAME] [--force] [--no-embeddings]
```

- `--store` — Curate a specific named store (default: all configured stores)
- `--force` — Run full curation instead of incremental (re-process all documents)
- `--no-embeddings` — Skip embedding generation for curated files

## Content Sources

Dewey indexes content from four pluggable source types. Configure them in `.uf/dewey/sources.yaml`:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: local-vault
    type: disk
    config:
      path: .

  - name: org-repos
    type: github
    config:
      org: your-org
      repos:
        - repo-one
        - repo-two
      content_types:
        - issues
        - pulls
        - readmes
    refresh: daily

  - name: go-docs
    type: web
    config:
      urls:
        - https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra
      depth: 2
    refresh: weekly
```

You can also add sources via the CLI instead of editing YAML directly:

```bash
dewey source add github --org your-org --repos repo-one,repo-two
dewey source add web --url https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra --depth 2
```

After adding sources, build the index:

```bash
dewey index             # incremental — only fetches sources past their refresh interval
dewey index --force     # full rebuild — re-fetches everything
```

### Code Source

The `code` source type indexes source code files using language-aware AST chunking. Currently supports Go, with a pluggable architecture for additional languages.

```yaml
  - name: project-code
    type: code
    config:
      path: "../replicator"
      languages:
        - go
```

The Go chunker extracts: package doc comments, exported function/method signatures, type declarations, Cobra CLI commands, and MCP tool registrations. Test files are excluded by default.

### Ignore Support

Dewey respects `.gitignore` files at the root of each source directory. Additionally, disk and code sources support `ignore` and `recursive` fields in `sources.yaml`:

```yaml
  - name: disk-website
    type: disk
    config:
      path: "../website"
      ignore: [drafts, temp]     # additional patterns beyond .gitignore
      recursive: true            # set false for top-level files only
```

## Semantic Search Setup

Semantic search requires an embedding provider. Dewey defaults to [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) running locally, but also supports [Google Vertex AI](#vertex-ai-provider). All keyword-based tools work without an embedding provider — only the 3 semantic search tools (`semantic_search`, `similar`, `semantic_search_filtered`) require one.

### Ollama (Default)

Dewey auto-starts Ollama if it's installed but not running. No manual `ollama serve` needed — Dewey detects Ollama's state (External/Managed/Unavailable) and starts a subprocess if necessary. The subprocess is detached so it outlives Dewey.

```bash
brew install --cask ollama-app  # macOS — or download from https://ollama.ai
ollama pull granite-embedding:30m   # IBM Granite, 63 MB, Apache 2.0
```

### Verify

```bash
dewey status
```

The output shows embedding coverage. If Ollama is running and the model is pulled, you'll see embedding stats. If the provider is unavailable, Dewey logs a warning at startup and disables semantic search — all other tools continue to work normally.

### Provider Configuration

Embedding and synthesis providers are configurable via `.uf/dewey/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Ollama (default — no config needed if defaults are fine)
embedding:
  provider: ollama
  model: granite-embedding:30m
  endpoint: http://localhost:11434

# Vertex AI — for cloud-powered embeddings or synthesis
embedding:
  provider: vertex
  model: text-embedding-005
  project: my-gcp-project
  region: us-central1

synthesis:
  provider: vertex
  model: claude-sonnet-4-6
  project: my-gcp-project
  region: us-east5
```

You can mix providers — e.g., Ollama for embeddings (fast, local) and Vertex AI for synthesis (high quality):

```yaml
embedding:
  provider: ollama
  model: granite-embedding:30m

synthesis:
  provider: vertex
  model: claude-sonnet-4-6
  project: my-gcp-project
  region: us-east5
```

#### Vertex AI Provider

Vertex AI requires Google Cloud application-default credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
```

Set `project` and `region` in your config to match your GCP setup. Vertex AI embedding models (e.g., `text-embedding-005`) and Claude synthesis models (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-6`) must be enabled in your GCP project.

**Note**: Switching embedding providers changes vector dimensions. Run `dewey reindex` after changing the embedding model.

**Rate limiting**: Vertex AI providers automatically retry on HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) with exponential backoff and jitter — base delay 1 second, maximum 60 seconds, up to 5 attempts. The `Retry-After` header is respected when present. If retries are exhausted, the error is returned to the caller.

#### Global Config

Create `~/.config/dewey/config.yaml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dewey/config.yaml`) to set defaults for all vaults. Per-vault config overrides global.

#### Environment Variables

Environment variables override config file values for embedding. For synthesis, they serve as fallbacks when no config exists.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DEWEY_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `granite-embedding:30m` | Embedding model (overrides config) |
| `DEWEY_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:11434` | Embedding API endpoint (overrides config) |
| `DEWEY_GENERATION_MODEL` | *(none)* | Synthesis model (fallback when no config) |

## Knowledge Compilation

Dewey can synthesize stored learnings into compiled knowledge articles using an LLM. The `compile` tool reads all learnings, clusters them by topic tag, and produces current-state articles that resolve temporal contradictions — newer facts replace older ones, while non-contradicted information carries forward.

Agents can also compile knowledge directly: call `compile` to receive synthesis prompts, perform synthesis with any model, then call `store_compiled` to persist the result with provenance tracking. This enables agent-driven compilation without requiring a local LLM.

### Trust Tiers

All content in Dewey's index has a trust tier:

| Tier | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `authored` | Disk, GitHub, web, code sources | Human-written content. Highest trust. |
| `curated` | `curate`, knowledge stores | Machine-extracted knowledge. LLM-curated with quality flags. |
| `validated` | `promote` | Agent content promoted by human review. |
| `draft` | `store_learning`, `compile` | Agent-generated. Unreviewed. |
| `untrusted` | Source config | Content from sources marked as lower trust. |

Filter search by tier: `semantic_search_filtered(query: "auth", tier: "authored")`
Filter curated content: `semantic_search_filtered(query: "auth", tier: "curated")`

### Knowledge Stores

Knowledge stores are named collections of curated knowledge extracted from indexed sources. Configure them in `.uf/dewey/knowledge-stores.yaml`:

```yaml
stores:
  - name: team-knowledge
    sources:
      - disk-meetings
      - github-org
    curation_interval: "10m"
```

Run `dewey curate` to extract knowledge, or let background curation handle it automatically during `dewey serve`. Curated files are written to `.uf/dewey/knowledge/{store-name}/` and automatically indexed with `tier: "curated"` for immediate searchability.

Each curated knowledge item includes:
- **Confidence scoring**: `high`, `medium`, `low`, or `flagged`
- **Quality flags**: `missing_rationale`, `implied_assumption`, `incongruent`, `unsupported_claim`
- **Source traceability**: Every fact traces back to its source document

Learnings stored via `store_learning` are also dual-written to `.uf/dewey/learnings/` as markdown files, ensuring they survive database deletion.

### Content Sanitization

Dewey scans indexed content for security threats and structural anomalies through five defense layers:

1. **Injection pattern scanning** — Detects prompt injection attempts (instruction overrides, role reassignment, delimiter injection) using compiled regex patterns with severity calibration (critical/high/medium)
2. **Content hash drift detection** — Tracks content changes between index cycles via SHA-256 hash comparison
3. **Markdown structure validation** — Identifies invisible Unicode characters, embedded data URIs, invalid heading depth, and suspicious HTML tags (`<script>`, `<iframe>`, event handlers)
4. **Content size anomaly detection** — Statistical outlier detection using 3-sigma threshold across source documents (requires 5+ documents per source)
5. **Trust tier assignment** — Sources can be marked with explicit trust levels, with `untrusted` tier for lower-trust external content

#### Sanitization Configuration

Configure sanitization per-source in `.uf/dewey/sources.yaml`:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: external-wiki
    type: web
    config:
      urls:
        - https://wiki.example.com
    trust_tier: untrusted       # authored (default), curated, validated, draft, untrusted
    sanitize_mode: strict       # warn (default for web/github), strict, off (default for disk/code)
```

- **`sanitize_mode: warn`** — Scan content and merge findings into page properties. Content is still indexed. Default for `web` and `github` sources.
- **`sanitize_mode: strict`** — Reject documents with `critical` or `high` severity findings. Documents are skipped during indexing.
- **`sanitize_mode: off`** — Skip sanitization entirely. Default for `disk` and `code` sources (user-authored content).

#### Interpreting Findings

Use `dewey doctor` to see an aggregated summary of sanitization findings by source and severity:

```bash
dewey doctor --vault /path/to/vault
```

Use `dewey lint` to see per-page findings with severity and pattern version:

```bash
dewey lint --vault /path/to/vault
```

When patterns are updated in a new Dewey release, `dewey lint` flags stale findings and recommends `dewey reindex` to re-scan with updated patterns.

### Instant Startup

When `dewey serve` starts, the MCP server is ready within 1 second. Vault indexing runs in the background — tools serve from the persistent store (previous session's data) while indexing completes. The `health` tool reports indexing status.
